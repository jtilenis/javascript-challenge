# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

In this homework assignment I pull a dataset of UFO sightings and display the data on a web page.

I have created two different html pages.

## UFO Level 1
This web page appends data to a table on a web page and then adds new rows of data to each UFO sighting.
The columns displayed are `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.
There is a date input form on the web page which allows for filtering of data by date. 
Javascript code is used to listen for date events and search through rows to find matching datetime with user inputs.
If the date input field is empty or blank all records will be displayed.

## UFO Level 2
This web page is the same as the one described in UFO Level 1. Additional search options were added that allow for the selection of: 
    1. `date/time`
    2. `city`
    3. `state`
    4. `country`
    5. `shape`
